# Data Structure Stack

## Type: Restricted Access
We can iterate over the stack but WE CANÂ´T and remove or insert nodes at any position, just at THE END (top of the stack)
## Basic Operations
- POP - Remove an element and return the data that was removed
- PUSH - Add an element
- RESET - Reset the stack, often used in start
- CLEAR - Clear all data from the stack
- FULL - Check if the stack if full
- EMPTY - Check if the stack is empty

## LIFO - Last in First Out
In the LIFO structure, we PUSH and POP elements from the top of the list.
The pointers base and top hold respectively the first element of the stack and the last one.
