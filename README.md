<h1 id="project">Data Structure and Algorithm</h1>

This repository was created to store my every week learnings about Algorithm and Data Structure with C, such as dynamic memory allocation, insertion sort etc.

<h2 id="algorithms">Learnings</h2>

<h3>1st week: review Dynamic Memory Allocation</h3>
<h4> Store Names </h4>
 This algorithm dynamic store names in one string, allowing the user to add, remove and list all names.

<h4> Store Person </h4>
 This algorithm dynamic store person in a person buffer (using linked lists), allowing the user to add, remove and list all people. Each person has 4 infos: name (char with 10 caracteres maximum), age (integer), phone number (long integer) and next (pointer to the next person on the list)
